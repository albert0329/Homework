      "NASA's Opportunity Mars rover mission is complete after 15 years on Mars. Opportunity's record-breaking exploration laid the groundwork for future missions to the Red Planet.\n",
      "The lander's second instrument is on the ground. But its ‘mole’ — a burrowing probe — has a long way to go.\n",
      "NASA will discuss the status of its Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity in a media briefing at 11 a.m. PST (2 p.m. EST) Wednesday, Feb. 13, from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n",
      "The MAVEN spacecraft today is starting a campaign to tighten its orbit around Mars to prepare to serve as a data-relay satellite for NASA’s Mars 2020 rover, which launches next year.\n",
      "This panorama from the Mast Camera (Mastcam) on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover was taken on Dec. 19 (Sol 2265). The rover's last drill location on Vera Rubin Ridge is visible, as well as the clay region it will spend the next year exploring.\n",
      "The first CubeSat mission to deep space may have reached their limit, but they could inspire future NASA missions.\n",
      "A domed shield has been set over one of InSight's primary science instruments, protecting it from Mars' wind and temperature changes.\n",
      "Smartphone-like sensors on the NASA rover were used to calculate the density of Mount Sharp, offering new clues to its formation.\n",
      "The Mars rover is moving on and has taken its last selfie on the ridge it's explored for more than a year.\n",
      "Engineers at JPL have begun transmitting a new set of commands to Opportunity in an attempt to compel the Mars rover to contact Earth.\n",
      "The rover landed in a region of the Red Planet called Meridiani Planum 16 years ago today, on Jan. 24, 2004.\n",
      "In deploying its first instrument onto the surface of Mars, the lander completes a major mission milestone.\n",
      "Reconstructing Mars here on Earth lets them practice setting down the lander's science instruments.\n",
      "Look closely, and you can make out the lander's solar panels.\n",
      "Two new image mosaics detail the lander's deck and \"workspace\" — the surface where it will eventually set down its science instruments.\n",
      "Vibrations picked up by two spacecraft instruments have provided the first sounds of Martian wind.\n",
      "Now unstowed, the spacecraft's robotic arm will point a camera located on its elbow and take images of the surroundings.\n",
      "With InSight safely on the surface of Mars, the mission team is busy learning more about the spacecraft's landing site.\n",
      "A pair of tiny, experimental spacecraft fulfilled their mission yesterday, relaying back near-real-time data during InSight's landing.\n",
      "The lander has sent data indicating its solar panels are open and receiving sunlight to power its surface operations.\n",
      "The touchdown marks the eighth time NASA has successfully landed a spacecraft on Mars.\n",
      "NASA's InSight spacecraft is on target for Mars landing at around noon PST today.\n",

      "NASA's Mars InSight spacecraft is on track for a soft touchdown on the surface of the Red Planet on Nov. 26.\n",
      "In studying Mars, NASA's InSight will reveal what makes one planet more or less suitable for life than another.\n",
      "After a five-year search, NASA has chosen Jezero Crater as the landing site for its upcoming Mars 2020 rover mission.\n",
      "NASA will host a media teleconference at 9 a.m. PST (noon EST) Monday, Nov. 19, to provide details about the Mars 2020 rover’s landing site on the Red Planet.\n",
      "On Nov. 26, engineers will look for a combination of signals to determine whether the next spacecraft to Mars lands safely.\n",
      "NASA's InSight lander is scheduled to touch down on the Red Planet at approximately noon PST  on Nov. 26, with a new suite of instruments to probe below the Martian surface.\n",
      "NASA's Mars Curiosity rover drove about 197 feet over the weekend to a site called Lake Orcadie, pushing its total odometry to over 12 miles.\n",
      "If the InSight landing zone were ice cream, it would be vanilla.\n",
      "NASA engineers will be holding their breath when their spacecraft heads into Mars' atmosphere on Nov. 26.\n",
      "NASA's new eight-episode series 'On a Mission' follows the InSight spacecraft on its journey to Mars and details the extraordinary challenges of landing on the Red Planet.\n",
      "After a review of the progress of the listening campaign, NASA will continue its current strategy for attempting to make contact with the Opportunity rover for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "The supersonic parachute that will handle the heaviest payload yet to the Red Planet – Mars 2020 rover – passes its final sounding rocket test with flying colors.\n",
      "A briefing on NASA's upcoming InSight Mars landing will air on Wed. Oct. 31 at 1:30 p.m. EDT (10:30 a.m. PDT) on NASA TV, the agency's website and NASA InSight Facebook Page.\n",
      "The lander's unique science can teach us how planets are born.\n",
      "The image was produced by one of the twin briefcase-sized MarCO spacecraft, the first CubeSats to fly to deep space.\n",
      "NASA's InSight lander will be the first mission to use a robotic arm to grasp instruments from the spacecraft and place them on the surface of another planet. \n"
